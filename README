SkyFire Database is a World of Warcraft game databse. It is derived
from many sources.

For further information on the Skyfire project, please visit our
project website at http://www.projectskyfire.org.

SQL files to create the database can be found in the dev directory. Files
to update your database from an older revision/version can be found in the
updates directory.

Use our installer to install on windows.
A linux installer is in the works.

Special thanks to these other fine projects.
Without them there would be no Project Skyfire.
